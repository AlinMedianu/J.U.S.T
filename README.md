# J.U.S.T
J.U.S.T is a  university group project made by 3 programmers and 3 artists. My main contribution was this game's AI. It consists of a scout behaviour, passive, runs away from the players and alerts the guards, which are more aggressive. When these enemies are grouped out, they work as a team, tracking the players down and shooting them.
